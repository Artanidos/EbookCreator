<p style="page-break-before: always"><h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>

<p>First of all, this is a NO-BUDGET-Project. Please excuse my English. I did not find an editor and English is not my mother tongue, so there might be a few mistakes and my grammar might not be the best.  </p>

<p>If you don't like to read books with failures, then it's might not be for you. Give it to someone else instead of complaining. Complaining does not help you and it does not help me.</p>

<p>But if you find this book kind of valuable, then I invite you to create a recession at Amazon and leave a few stars for the rating, that helps other people to find my book and it helps me to survive and wright more book.</p>

<p>I went to almost every situation, I am writing here in this book, on my own. Some stories are from someone else, but if I don't mention the name of someone else, then I was going through this personally.  </p>

<p>By the way...all names in this book are just fiction, to not to blame someone of these nice people who have told me their stories.  </p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"><h1 id="how-to-step-out">How to <strong>Step Out</strong></h1>

<p>A guideline how you can step out of this system.
This guideline is based on my own experience and will be enriched with true stories from people I met on my way or people who wrote me believable stories.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Why do we step out at all?
You know...it began with these kings crusaders. They owned the land and make everybody else their slaves. It did not really looked like slavery, but who gave the land to the kings? Why should everybody else give a cent to the kings? <br />
They have stolen the land and have protected what they steel with their army. <br />
Maybe you might think now, "but the land belong to their parent and the get it from the parents". Yes that's right, but where did the parents get it from? <br />
If there is property, somebody has stolen it from us, from the mankind. <br />
You can see it in America and in the so called western. These people has stolen the land from the indigenous people who lived there before. Even the indigenous people did not own the land, they just used it. Which is the normal way, but after inventing agriculture we start to create properties. We don't wanted to let other people eat our fruits, because we have invested time to grow them. So we build fences around the land and declare it as our land now. This is also the time where humans become slaves and this is also true for the women who lived with one of these farmers. The farmer wanted to be sure that when he feeds the children of his wife, that he only feeds his own children and not the children of someone else. So we invented monogamy. <br />
If you have ever lived long enough together with only one partner, then you might know that she tries to control you with her sexuality. <br />
And also the workers for the farmers where paid and could live at the farmers houses, but they where not free. If they quit their job, they also loose their homes. <br />
This was the beginning of the slavery which we can see also today, even if it's more hidden. <br />
You might feel this. <br />
Do you know that your government does not want you to use land to grow food? <br />
Do you know that your government does not want you to build your own house?
Your government has occupied all the land. Your land, our land. And they do not give us something in return. Of course their are some countries who are paying social money, but they only pay that, after you paid something in. So the other people are paying for you, not the government. But they are asking for taxes. The are not only asking they are pressing it out of you.  </p>

<p>I compare it with my current style of living. I do not pay rent for a house. I do not pay for insurances. I only pay for food and sometimes for gas. I am playing music in the streets only 3 times a week for 2 hours. So I work so to say only 6 hours a week. And I feel that I have got everything I need. <br />
Why do you still work 40 hours a week? What is you goal to achieve and why are you doing a work you don't love at all.  </p>

<p>I will tell you. They tell you that you should have a big house, a big car and fine clothes and so on and so forth. They are keeping you in fear. They tell you, that if you are quitting your job, you will loose all of this and will become a beggar. <br />
In fact you have a house which is empty the whole day, because you are working. You have got a car to drive to your job and you are wearing these fine clothes so that the people accept you doing your job. <br />
You don't need this at all.</p>

<h2 id="fears">Fears</h2>

<p>The main reason why so many people are still in the system is fear. The people, and maybe it's also true for you, are scared to quit what they are doing, because the system is scaring them.  </p>

<p>When I say quit, I mean, liberate yourself from being a slave to the society. <br />
If you fear to loose your job you will be a good worker. You are coming on time every day. You do your job the best you can and you produce money for the boss. It's all about creating much money for your boss.</p>

<p>I don't wanne blame your boss. He or she is also just a victim of our society. </p>

<p>When you grow up everybody is telling you something like the following:
"You have to learn something." <br />
"You have to become someone." <br />
"You should study something." <br />
"You should go to work." <br />
"If you are hungry, then you have to work, to get money and to buy food." <br />
"You have to become rich to survive."  </p>

<p>All these good advises are coming from people who still belief in this system. They don't know it better, so they are not able to give you a better advice. <br />
Anf If people wake up and are going to tell you te truth, they would embarrass themselves, because they have been fallen into this trap for years.</p>

<p>There are all these companies who know about fear and they use this fear to make you scared to make more money. I don't wanne blame them, I already told you, they don't know it better. <br />
There is for example the insurances. They telling you that you might have an accident and therefore you need an insurance. And if you have got an insurance no accidents will happen, because you don't fear them any more.  </p>

<p>What I want to say is...if you fear something, your are manifesting it. It will come to your life. This is the law of attraction. If you want something very bad or you fear something, you have got a focus on that. And when you have got a focus on something, then it will come to your life.  </p>

<h2 id="system">System</h2>

<p>What is the so called system you may ask?
The system is called capitalism or communism. Everybody in the system has to work to make money. Money we need to pay the rent for our house or flat and we need money to buy food etc.
In countries where the children are not able to go to school and to go to university they have to work. I am talking about hard work. I am talking about children at the age of 8 years or even younger that are working for these companies that are abusing these little beings with very low salaries.  </p>

<p>If your parents where not able to pay for your school and your university you have no good chances to get a good, well payed job at all. You are to stay poor for the rest of your life.
Even if you have got a good job in the town, you are not able to pay a flat or a house there, so you have to travel many kilometres each day. <br />
The bad thing about the system is, that only a few people which are already rich will get more and more money from the poor people, while the poor people get poorer and poorer. <br />
Also the governments have to go into more debts each year without the chance to pay back the debts at all. <br />
So they have to pay more interest rates every year and the people of these countries have to pay more and more taxes.  </p>

<p>I have had a company in Germany and I had to pay about 45 percent income taxes. In Denmark the people have to pay even more. 51 percent income taxes plus additional 25 percent value added taxes. So if you work in Denmark you are only getting 25 percent of your salary to live from. 
That is slavery!</p>

<p>While in Switzerland I did the same job as in Germany and I only had to pay 12 percent income taxes and only 8 percent value added taxes, which is 20 percent combined. Also too high, but compared to Denmark acceptable.</p>

<p>So what is the government in Switzerland doing better than the government in Denmark?
In Switzerland they have got direct democracy. So the people decide how much taxes to pay and what to spent taxes for.
In Denmark and Germany it is poor <strong>slavery</strong>. <br />
Do you know that unemployed people in Germany could have been sanctioned not accepting a job or not attending to an interview or something like this? These poor people have to take every job they offer them. So the people have to work in the defense industry otherwise they will not get any money from the government even if they were paying taxes for many many years. They will loose their homes, because they are not able to pay the rent any more and they will literally die, because they are not able to buy food any more. <br />
Luckily a good friend of mine from Berlin was fighting for our human rights for many years, but still they are able to cut this money for 30 percent. This is still against the human rights. So without the right to live a good life I call it <strong>slavery</strong>. <br />
I personally have also been cutted to 100 percent. I am not getting any money from the so called jobcenter any more, because I am now in Portugal and was not following the invitations of the jobcenter. I have not told them, that I am in Portugal, so they don't know, but still not paying me any more. So they still ignoring my human rights. I am in a good situation. I can help myself. But all the other sheeples are not able to. So the governments is not only risking their lives, they are also risking the other peoples life, because when someone is not getting any money he or she might get into crime.  </p>

<p>The idea that people should pay tithes (10 percent of the annual produce of land or labour) to support their minister and church was established in the 8th century.  </p>

<p>Even 10 percent was to much for the people.  </p>

<p>So what has happened? <br />
Yeah, it's the debts of the governments. They for example were building these really large buildings to govern the people. They needed the military to defend the country and in case of the USA they spend a huge amount of taxes to fight against countries which have oil to control these countries.  </p>

<p>The governments are also imprison us at home, because of this corona virus. There are many scientist already saying that this virus exists since a few years, and that you will find it in most of us, but it is not breaking out. Only very young and very old people are dying from this. But the truth is, they will die anyways because of other diseases. So they might use this pandemy to vaccinate all of us based on a new law. In Denmark they already have created this law. 
And who is the winner? 
Big pharma.
Also it could be possible that they use this pandemy to forbid cash money. And then, they are able to control us. They know where we are, even if we do not use smartphoes any more, and they know, what we are buying, in which bordell we are going, how much alcohol we drink and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>These are only a few examples...there is more wrong with these governments, and we have to stop them NOW!</p>

<p>Maybe I am wrong. Hopefully. Lets manifest that everything is for a good reason &lt;3  </p>

<p>This system drains our planet that we are not able to survive that long. There is no <strong>plan</strong>et <strong>B</strong>.  </p>

<p>We have to get rid of these so called elite who are controlling our governments.  </p>

<p>Do you know that most of our laws are just there to make these people more rich?  </p>

<p>Why is it forbidden to collect rain water in the USA? Why do you have to pay electricity in Spain even if you produce it on your own with solar panels? Why does Madrid not accept, that Catalunia will be separarted from Spain? 
Why do they kill inventors like Tesla?</p>

<p>You just have to follow the track of the money!</p>

<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>

<p>I see some solutions to step out and how to ignore the system. It it easy if you know how to, but it might be a challenge for some people.  </p>

<p>The easy way is to not give any might to the governments and the big companies. If we don't give them their might, then they are powerless. I mean paying taxes. If we would stop paying taxes the politician will look for another job. I do not mean to just stop to pay, I mean, do not work that much any more and you will earn less and then you do not have to pay much taxes.
If we don't take out credits any more, then the banksters will get bankrupt. The word bankrupt comes from bank and disruption. <br />
If we do not use their money any more they will loose their power. If we do not buy their products then the companies will also get bankrupt.</p>

<p>So we don't have to fight against the system. We just not feed it any more!  </p>

<p>Just easy.  </p>

<p>To be honest this is hard, because we have to rethink how to live, where to live what to eat.  </p>

<p>This book will give you some hints.  </p>

<p>You don't have to live that extreme like me. <br />
I was once working for the banksters in Zürich getting a 5 digit amount each month and now, after two burnouts I am living without any income from busking in the streets and food saving.   And no, I don't have savings to live from. <br />
But I am free. <br />
I am waking up without the need of an alarm clock. <br />
They birds are waking me up, or at the very moment the waves are waking me up, when they break at the shore. I am in Nazare, Portugal, right now. Here you can see the biggest waves in the whole world. 20 meters and higher. <br />
This is freedom...to be somewhere you want to be. <br />
Not in an office nor a factory.</p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"><h1 id="how-i-did-it">How I did it</h1>

<p>2014 I was working for the banksters in Zürich, getting a 5 digit amount each single month, I already told you, and I was not that happy as today. <br />
I was teaching myself to develop software and made it my hobby. Later I was able to make a bunch of money with it until I realized that I was only doing it for the money and not for fun any more.  </p>

<p>My body was telling me to stop it. I had to go trough two burnouts with a near death experience to be able to really say "STOP!"  </p>

<p>I had the luck, so to say, that I was getting homeless. I was living a few days in the north of Germany in my Toyota Scarlet next to the train station where I had a toilet.  </p>

<p>Luckily I was not poor and was able to buy myself a mobile home. In this mobile home I am living now in Portugal and I have much fun.  </p>

<p>This is the very first month I am living without income. To be honest this is my 4th book and I get a little money from selling at least one of these books. It's just 30-50,- € a month, but it helps to survive.  </p>

<p>The rest of the money I am getting from playing guitar and djembe in the streets. <br />
Living in a van I do not pay anything else. No house, no electricity, no other bills. 
Just food, which I sometimes find in the trash, and gas for the van to travel. <br />
Of course I should pay taxes and insurance for the van, but...  </p>

<p>Years ago, I was doing motocross, I already had the idea to buy myself a camper and travel from one track to another, but I was to scared to give up my well paid job. What I want to say is that I was imagining to live in a van. Imagination is a key to manifest things. If you can imagine something, you can manifest it. <br />
So did I...unconsciously. And the van came 8 years later to me. <br />
The van was a very good deal. 29 years old, first hand. I bought it from a couple, her parents were driving it and before her grannies. <br />
I only paid 4.000,- €. As I already said, I was homeless but not poor.  </p>

<p>Of course it is a risk to buy such an old van, but I was a mechanic long ago. I don't want to repair the car totally on my own, but I am able to and I am able to show competence to a garage, so that they will not try to betray me.  </p>

<p>I am now living in my van since 4.5 years and I stopped working 6 years ago. It's easy to live with just the money from the jobcenter in Germany. They had paid 420,- € a month, when I was not sanctioned by them. Additionally they also paid for taxes, insurance and I had to show the van to TüV, where they check the van and the jobcenter had paid me 2.500,- € to repair my van, so that I am able to use it for living the next two years. <br />
I know this is a very exception in Germany, but I was able to manifest it. You are also able to manifest something like that, you just have to belief in it. <strong>You are creating your reality!</strong>  </p>

<p>Now that I am in Portugal for the winter they stopped to pay me, but it's ok. I will survive, because I am a musician and I am creative.   </p>

<p>I started to play music on the streets in Berlin. There was this nice guy from Ghana I was playing with. He did the beat on an old snare drum and I was able to play along on my djembe. </p>

<p>Last year, in December, I went to the tourist information to check my emails, they have free wifi there and I asked: "Is it allowed to make music here in the streets?" "Yes, but you have to register.", the nice lady replied. "Where can I register?",I asked? "Here"  </p>

<p>I was playing guitar for the very first time here. A friend was busking in the street and I was sitting next to him. While he was making a break, I took his guitar and started to play. No shame, no fear and the people smiled and gave some coins. <br />
Estou agradecido. <br />
Thank you Portugal, I love you &lt;3  </p>

<p>So now I am an authorized musician. That feels really good. I was busking alone for the very first time at the 24th of December. Playing just 1.5 hours I got 24 €. Wow, in Portugal I am able to live 6 days with that money. I only need about 4,- € a day. I do not smoke tobacco. I do not pay for weed. I rarely drink beer and wine and I cook for myself. <br />
The only bad habit is drinking coffee, but I am sometimes going to ask for some beans in a cafe, if I am low on money. <br />
Now after editing what I wrote I should be honest, I also like to drink red wine and I bought a 5 liter pack at Lidl for about 5,- €. In Germany we call it <strong>Pennerglück</strong> ;-)
The luck of the homeless.
Rich people have to pay hundreds of euros for a good wine and I only have to pay 1,- €.  </p>

<p>Because of the fact, that I am able to make money every day, doing what I love to do, gives me all the freedom I need to be creative.  </p>

<p>With this freedom I am able to create useful content to make this planet a little better.  </p>

<p><strong>SO CAN YOU</strong></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"><h1 id="some-options-to-live-a-good-life">Some Options to Live a Good Life</h1>

<p>I am not able to tell you how to live a good life. This depends on your wishes and circumstances, but I might show you some options how you can create a nice living out of the system.  </p>

<p>There is one thing you should keep in mind. Your life should fulfil you. Only you. Don't do anything you don't want at all. Don't make compromises to make someone else happy. Not even your sexual partner or your best friend. <br />
If you partner or friend does not like how your are living, then maybe it's not the right partner or friend for you. And you don't have to live together at all. Just meet each other from time to time is also nice.  </p>

<h2 id="living">Living</h2>

<h3 id="community">Community</h3>

<p>Living together in a community has many challenges. I think there are as many stories as there are communities and people living there. <br />
If you want to live in a community you might have to make compromises. I know that I wrote about not to make them, but...
...if you are able to find consensus with all people in the community, then it's not really a compromise...it's consensus then. You do agree to do it. <br />
Consensus means, that everybody in the community does agree with the consensus.  </p>

<p>Example: If there are smokers in your community and you have got a common teepee. It could be that some of you don't like the smoke or the smell. This one might bring the point into a talking circle. Then it's up to the community to find a way to live with this.
You might then collect some possible scenarios like.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Do not smoke in the teepee.</li>
<li>Do not stay in the teepee if you don't like smoke.  </li>
<li>Do not smoke while having a talking circle.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Keep one rule in mind: <br />
"If it's not good for everybody, then it's not good at all." <br />
~Michael Tellinger (UBUNTU Movement)</p>

<p>A consensus means everybody will be ok with this kind of rule. In the above case it could be that all agree not to smoke in the teepee. It could also be that this one guy just avoids the teepee. Depends. Maybe the last option could be a good option for everybody. But keep in mind that everybody in the circle should agree. You may look also for other options if there is no consensus yet.</p>

<p>There is also a possibility to have a systemic consensus, if you do not find a solution, because there are maybe to many options, because their are many people in the circle.
To calculate what is the consensus you can use the following technique.
Everybody in the circle can vote all options with a kind of rating. The rating goes from 0-2 (0-10 is a valuable rating for circles with more people).  </p>

<ul>
<li>2 means that this option is a NO-GO  </li>
<li>1 means...I don't like it, but it's ok anyway  </li>
<li>0 means, I agree with this option  </li>
</ul>

<p>So the more you dislike an option, the more rating points you give. If there is one in the community, who does not want to attend to the circle to find consensus, then for him or her it's 0 points for all options. Now everybody votes for each option. Then the option with the least points will make it. But do not make the mistake to try to find consensus while one person is away. This person might bring the topic to the next circle again, but yes...this is how it works. <br />
Example: There are 5 people in the circle and they are voting as follows.  </p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Options</th>
  <th align="center">Smoker A</th>
  <th align="center">Smoker B</th>
  <th align="center">Smoker C</th>
  <th align="center">Smoker D</th>
  <th align="center">Non-Smoker</th>
  <th align="center">Rating</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Not smoke</td>
  <td align="center">2</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">1</td>
  <td align="center">1</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Not smoke in talking circle</td>
  <td align="center">1</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Smoke in teepee</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">2</td>
  <td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In the above case the consensus is to smoke in the teepee but not while there is a talking circle, because this options has the least points, because only one of the smokers might think, "I wanne smoke every time, but ok, not while talking circle". The smoker can leave to teepee to have his cigarette.  </p>

<p>To have a more detailed version just search the web for <em>systemic consensus</em>.</p>

<h3 id="van-life">Van Life</h3>

<p>This is what I am doing right now. I am living in my van now since 4.5 years. Often I am just camping in the middle of a town. You are able to drive everywhere. You may camp on every camping slot and of course, this is what I do, camp wild. The last option is illegal in most countries, but nowadays the police know about the situations of these people who do not work and have no money. They normally just tell them to leave. In my case I was asked once in three years to leave in Berlin. The police officer was there with a woman and maybe he just wanted to show her, how a good officer he is. Because I wanted to go to Denmark anyway I said, "ok", to avoid an argument. <br />
Here in Portugal I had once police contact, because we were parking next to a museum, because they had free wifi, and somebody was calling the police and told them that our dogs are running around and shitting in the land of the museum and that we were taking the water from the museum. <br />
Long story short...I accepted to leave and parked my van 20 meters away ;-) <br />
The police has done their job and we were fine. <br />
They told me that they will give me a ticket, but I just said, "Ok, but I will not pay. I don't have money at all.", and they resignated. <br />
And if they still want to do it, I don't have an address at all, so they cannot send it to me. <br />
I am travelling with a passport. I do not show my id card. Sometimes I just show my swiss driver license. They might search me there in Switzerland ;-)</p>

<p>I do not use my toilet in van anymore because then I have to empty it every week. I use trees to pee and public toilets to get rid of other things. Sometimes I am using an empty bottle to pee and a bucket with a plastic back to make caca.  </p>

<p>To wash myself I am using the opportunities to shower at friends houses, I just jump into a lake, river or the ocean. In Nazaré I was also in the ocean in a kind of tricky way. I waited for the waves to reach me on the beach to have a kind of horizontal shower. I would not go in the ocean there with these 20 meter high waves. They might pull me in the ocean. <br />
I also find out that I only need 3-5 cups of water to wash the important parts of my body. <br />
Also I am most often do not use toilet paper. I use water or leaves instead and then I clean my hands with vinegar or ashes from a camp fire.</p>

<p>I have got a bicycle to go everywhere. That makes it easier to find a spot outside of the city. You are able to find spots next to schools or other public places. They are abondonend at the night and you just also stay there during the day. <br />
I burned all bridges before, so I do not have to pay for a house or a flat. My van is registered in Germany at my moms house. You can also ask friends to register at there address.  </p>

<p>I have got two solar panels with 200 watts and with them I can fill my mobile phone and with a converter I also have 220 Volts. I am able to fill my computer when it's not running, but I also have a very old Mac book G4 which is not loading, the converter switches of. In this case I often go to libraries to get electricity and also free wifi. Here in one town I also get electricity at the market place where they have got sockets below the banks. In Lissabon, the library was closed because of this pandemy, I was in a cafe behind the lib and they gave me a long cable for my computer, some water for my dog and I only had a coffee for 70 cents. It was a non profit cafe, fighgting for human rights. We are helping each other &lt;3</p>

<h3 id="living-on-a-sailing-yacht">Living on a sailing yacht</h3>

<p>One morning, I was camping in Bern (Switzerland) next to an old gas tank, which is now a place for GOA-Parties and other things, a woman knocked at my van. She ask me if I could help starting their car.  </p>

<p>These nice couple where in Bern to make some money during the winter. Yes Switzerland is a nice place to make a bunch of money, because they pay the higghest salaries in Europe and you only have to pay about 10 percent so called <em>Quellsteuer</em> which is a kind of income tax.  </p>

<p>They where living on a sailing yacht during the year. They bought the yacht right after she has finished her school in Germany. We were talking about the yacht, because I was interested to buy it. <br />
They told me that they were sailing around Mallorca and they live from food saving. The hotel there were throwing away much useful food. Sailing would be also nice for me. This way I do not waste much gas, only if I have to drive into a harbour, where sailing is not possible.</p>

<p>I have not done this yet, because I like to carry my kitesurf equip and my music instruments in my van. But if you have got a small car this will work. <br />
We met Bert and Hans, two German men in Nazaré. They were sleeping together with a dog in their Fiat Panda. They were also cooking inside this car. And they also had music instruments and surf equip. <br />
But if you don't want to sleep in a car, then the best would be to bring a tent.  </p>

<p>A few days ago I met Rolf from Sweden in Lisbon. He was with his bike and he told me, that he has got a tent outside of Lisbon.</p>

<h3 id="couch-surfing">Couch Surfing</h3>

<p>Have done this with my motorbike once. Travelled from Denmark to Switzerland. Visited a massage colleague there and then I was in the south of England where I was getting an invite from another massage colleague. <br />
There are many places on earth were you may find nice people who do not want to live alone, where you might stay a few days or weeks.</p>

<h3 id="biking-hiking">Biking, Hiking</h3>

<p>One day we met Gerd a man from Germany. He was with his bike and a trailer. He told us, that his tent is broken, I gave him my old military tent which I only used once at a rainbow gathering. It was not water proofed, but Gerd said that he will use this old tent as a tarp to protect my tent. He has already driven 5.000 km on his bike and he looked very happy and healthy of course.  </p>

<h3 id="squatting-houses">Squatting houses</h3>

<p>I have not done that yet, but a few friends told me about that. <br />
You find squats to live in, in almost every larger town. Just ask some hippies or punks. Avoid asking junkies, because they might show you a squat with many challenges. Maybe they can live there, me not. But there are nice places like the Gängeviertel in Hamburg, where these people squatted five houses where they are now creating art. The town bought these houses back from the investor and gave it to the people. There you can find a No-Money-Shop, a cafe without prices, you just donate something, a discotheque and many more.  </p>

<p>In Barcelona there is a nive squat where some artists are living. You can see a lot of paintings on the walls inside. <br />
A friend of mine was there for a few days.  </p>

<p>A friend told me about a squat in Lisbon, but he told me to avoid it, because it's really dirty there. As I said, it depends on the people living there.  </p>

<h3 id="grow-your-own-food">Grow your own food</h3>

<p>One possibility to step out completly is do buy land, build a shelter and grow food like permaculture. <br />
About this topic I wrote an own book called "Camp Eden, how we re-created our paradise"</p>

<h2 id="making-money">Making money</h2>

<p>If you do not want to support your system paying taxes, then you should stop working in the system. There are many ways to do that.
For me the easiest way to make money on the streets is busking. I am playing guitar in the streets.</p>

<p>Another way of doing this is to be self-employed and not live longer than 6 months in one country. You only have to pay taxes in a country where you are staying more than 6 months. So if you are living 4 months in Portugal for the winter and 4 months in Denmark for the summer and in between you are somewhere else like France or Germany, then your fine.  </p>

<h3 id="street-music">Street music</h3>

<p>I have started to live from making music in Portugal last December. I get a badge which shows that now I am authorized to make music. Sometimes I just get about 4,- € and sometimes it's for more than 20,- € for just two hours. I also tried it a few times in Lisbon, but these people are to much in their head right now. There you do not get that much. You should do it more in small towns with normal people. <br />
The best instrument is that one where you can play freely. Also singing is an option. I have trained my voice in the streets.   </p>

<h3 id="helping-musicians">Helping musicians</h3>

<p>Even if you are not a musician at all you are able to help other musicians using a magic hat and ask people around for some coins for the musicians. <br />
Also dancing in front of the musicians can help them to make some coins. This attracts other people to watch you and you might motivate them to dance also. <br />
Once a friend had the idea to collect some food. He went on the fruit market, which was next to were we have been playing and he asked the people to spent some spare food for the musicians. That days we were able to share food with 3 other women.</p>

<h3 id="juggling">Juggling</h3>

<p>You can juggle at the traffic lights where the people have to stop and wait. Therefore you have to ask people directly to give you some coins, which needs an "I give a shit mood". I am not their yet. But I will do it, when I get hungry one day. For sure. Btw, I have learned to juggle here in Portugal. I am 56 years now and I was able to do it. Got a video on youtube about that.</p>

<h3 id="painting-pictures">Painting pictures</h3>

<p>If you like painting, this is for you. You can create the paintings at home or you can do it life at the spot where you are selling them. It makes sense to combine it. <br />
Selling paintings is a time consuming job, but you are able to get to know some nice people doing it. You also may show your paintings somewhere else like a pub, a shop or somewhere else.  </p>

<h3 id="washing-cars">Washing cars</h3>

<p>In n I have seen some people from Bulgaria who helped people to find a parking lot. Some people are happy and give coins. You can also offer to clean their cars while they are going shopping or doing what ever they are doing. <br />
One of these guys ask me to remove a graffiti on my van. He had a strong liquid like turpentine or so. He erased all the graffiti on the front of my car. He was not asking for money, but I gave him the rest of the whiskey from the night before.</p>

<h3 id="dog-or-cat-sitting">Dog or cat sitting</h3>

<p>There a many people having animals which have to stay alone at home. Print some flyers where you offer your help and spread them at a supermarket. The people will be very happy to have someone looking after their dogs and cats. <br />
I did this with cats. Very nice, I can cuddle the whole day, have free electricity, a shower, wifi and get some coins in return.  Ok, I did not get coins this way because I helped a friend, but she invites my for dinner sometimes.  </p>

<h3 id="baby-sitting">Baby sitting</h3>

<p>The same as for cats is true for babies. They need someone to look after. You should be able to change pampers otherwise this job will be a pain in the ass, I mean in the nose ;-)  </p>

<h3 id="creating-useful-things">Creating useful things</h3>

<p>I have not done that yet, but in Lisbon I met a nice guy who create small pieces of art and sell them on the market. It's not really a market, but next to the coast there is a place where some people creates a kind of market on their own. <br />
The police does not do something against them, because otherwise these people might get criminal instead.  </p>

<h3 id="writing-books">Writing Books</h3>

<p>This is also something I am doing on a regular base. Once I wrote a bestseller, <br />
<strong>Python GUI - Develop Cross Plattform GUI Applications using Python, Qt and PyQt5</strong> <br />
from Olaf Japp <br />
,which brings me 30-40,- € each month. <br />
For writing a book I have created my own software the EbookCreator. The EbookCreator is open source and you are able to use it for free. It's running on Windows, Mac and of course Linux. <br />
Yes there are many other tools on the market to archive this. But I had a special need in colororing the syntax of the source code I was writing about. And I wanted to use Markdown to write books. Maybe you know Markdown from github already.    </p>

<p>You can self-publish your books on <a href="kdp.amazon.com">kdp.amazon.com</a> (Kindle direct publishing). <br />
With EbookCreator you can create epub3 books, which Amazon should accept. There is also a good way to publish ebooks in German language with Tolino Media. They want PDF instead. At the moment I am working on a solution to create PDF with my EbookCreator. <br />
I am using a 15 year old Mac with InDesign installed to create PDF versions of my books at the moment.  </p>

<p>As you can see, I am giving my books away for free as PDF. This may help poor people to get the content and it helps me to spread my books around the globe. I am also very into the open source philosophie. <br />
They are also available as ebook. These are easier to read on a kindle and on a smartphone and it gets me a small income.  </p>

<p>Once a friend ask me for my bank account. She was so grateful to read my book that she sends me 100,- €. <br />
Another friend in Switzerland shared my book with a few people. <br />
Two of them wanted to get to know me. The one invited me to stay at his bio farm, where I could learn about how to grow apples. And both of them supported me financial, after my mobile phone has been stolen in Madrid.  </p>

<p><strong>How to write a bestseller you may ask?</strong>  </p>

<p>There is an option in KDP where you can set the price of your book to 0,- € for a day or two and that very day you invite a bunch of people to download your book for free. <br />
This boost your download ranking and in my case the book was on place one in the chapter cross plattform development for a few days.  Even if I have got only a one star rating, the people buy it. Yeah, I could trick this situation, giving some friends money to buy this book and leave a 5 star rating, but I don't like to trick other people. That does not feel good. I know that someday this book will help someone and I get a 5 star rating to become a 3 star rating in average.  </p>

<p>To be honest, this book helped me once. Because I wanted to write an app for Android using Python and I did not remember how to get there ;-)  </p>

<p>You can also connect to some other authors and help each other writing recessions to make your book more famous to reach more people. <br />
You are worth to collect money for your book, because you took your time to write it, while other people were going to work an make money. <br />
Keep that in mind.</p>

<h1 id="saving-money">Saving money</h1>

<h3 id="food-saving">Food Saving</h3>

<p>Do you know that we are throwing away a third part of the whole food on this planet? <br />
If you are able to get your hands on this food you might also share it with other people, which is a very nice act of socializing. Sharing is caring. <br />
We were busking next to the fruit market and while counting our coins a friend said, "I will ask them if they have got spare food for the musicians." He came back with a big box of broccoli, apples, potatoes etc. <br />
I think, I have told this before, but...
You can also have a look at the trash cans of the super market. <br />
You might ask in the bakery a few minutes before they close if they have got spare bread, they cannot sell the next day. <br />
In Berlin I found a few refrigerators on the street where people put food to share inside. <br />
There are many options to fill an empty stomach.  </p>

<h3 id="fasting">Fasting</h3>

<p>While waiting here for the sun to disappear behind the horizon I had a look into my kindle for a nice book to read.
It was about prana food from Jasmuheen. <br />
Yes I am fasting on a regular base. Almost every two months for at least 5 days. I am doing this to save money and it's also really healthy. Your immune system resets after 3 days not eating. Breatharianism is something more higher. I not there yet, but two friends have tried it out. One of them two times. They just tried it. One week no food, not drinking at all. Both of them did not eat about 2 months. So, it is possible!
I have fasted with water for 12 days at a rainbow gathering. There I had very good energy. No distraction from a town. No ads, where they advertise for food. This is very hard, but...
...its possible. <br />
We do NOT have to eat at all. <br />
I have learned to fast or the other way round, to use prana from the earth and the sun, instead of using the prana from veggies or even animals. <br />
Deep in my heart I now that we do not have to eat at all.</p>

<p>That said, fasting is a way to save money and to become a breatharian will be the ultimate goal.  </p>

<h3 id="cold-coffee">Cold coffee</h3>

<p>If you do not have gas for cooking and you are not able to make a fire, you can drink also cold coffee. Just mix instant coffee with cold water and shake it in a jar or something similar.</p>

<h3 id="white-coffee">White coffee</h3>

<p>When I drink coffee I am smashing the coffee beans on my own. One day I forget to put the coffee into my cup and I get to know that I forgot to put it in after almost drinking the whole cup ;-)
This day I have invented <strong>White Coffee</strong>. To be honest, the name comes from a good friend. <br />
Now that another friend sent me the message, that we should drink hot water on a regular base to brink down the corona virus into the stomach to kill it, I am drinking White Coffee on a regular base, instead of expensive coffee.  </p>

<h3 id="saving-coffee">Saving Coffee</h3>

<p>To get some coffee beans I ask at a cafe or a gas station, if they have got a hand full off coffee beans for me. And I get it almost every time. For free of course.</p>

<h3 id="saving-diesel">Saving Diesel</h3>

<p>This idea I have seen from a good friend. He was going to the gas station and ask a driver who was filling his car, if he might donate some liters of diesel.
Just imagine you ask a truck driver who puts hundreds of liters in his truck. When he gives you 5 liters it will not be noticed by his boss. The truck driver does not have to pay for it at all. <br />
With 5 liter you can go the next 50 kilometers.  </p>

<h3 id="fixing-things">Fixing things</h3>

<p>First of all, think about the fact that you may not need so much things at all. <br />
Do you really need a tv set? If you like to pay money to get brain washed it may be an option ;-)
Before buying a new car, wouldn't it be better to buy yourself an oldtimer which can be repaired by a normal mechanic instead of expensive mechatronics? <br />
Maybe you have got a friend who is able to repair cars. It's much cheaper than to buy a new one which is made to break right after the guarantee phase. <br />
Also electronic devices can be repaired. <br />
When I grow up we are also giving our shoes to someone who repaired them for us.  </p>

<h3 id="room-saving">Room Saving</h3>

<p>This is just a theory now, but we should try to manifest it. <br />
If you see an abondonend shop, ask the owner if you may use the shop to make a workshop for example. You make a workshop based on donations and share the money with the owner. For them it's additional money and for you it's a free space. The owner will also profit from the fact that you clean the rooms.  </p>

<h3 id="finding-cheap-spots-to-eat">Finding cheap spots to eat</h3>

<p>Look for restaurants without tourism. The restaurant next to the beach are sooo expensive compared to these restaurant which are for the local people. Ask a local for these restaurants and maybe you might also get an invitation for a dinner. All people on this planet are nice and want to help. You only know about bad people from these movies. And of course there are bad guys who try to copy these bad guys from the movies, but deep in their hearts they are nice, like you are.  </p>

<h2 id="ultimate-goal">Ultimate goal</h2>

<h3 id="travelling-and-living-without-anything">Travelling and living without anything</h3>

<p>This topic is still fiction for me, but a good friend ask me once. "Why do you want to carry a back pack at all. Everything is already there were you are going to."  </p>

<p>Do you already know who you are? <br />
If so, why are you reading this book at all?  </p>

<p>I pull the question back ;-)  </p>

<p>Do you know that you are able to manifest everything you can imagine? <br />
To be honest, while writing this book, I am not there yet completely, but I have an idea of how to do it. It's all based on what we believe. <br />
To manifest things I am using Psych-K which I describe later in this book.  </p>

<p>Manifestations are based on the so called placebo effect. <br />
If you believe that the pill which the doctor gives you will heal you, then you will get healed. It's not that the doctor heals you nor does the pill do, you are healing yourself.  </p>

<p>If you know, that you are healing yourself, and you know who has developed your body after your parents had fun to put the egg and the sperm together, than you know what god is all about. <br />
Do not look outside to find god. <br />
Have a look inside. <br />
And if you believe that god has created this beautiful universe, then you know what you are able to do. <br />
You are the creator of your reality. <br />
You are able to create whatever you want to. <br />
You can be whatever you like to be.  </p>

<p>There was an offer which says, "If you test the corona virus for us, we will pay you 4.000,- €" <br />
I was thinking about that for a while. I would do that to show that we are more than just people and that we are able to survive, but I refused, because then they will play with me, keeping me away from other people, testing my blood every day, putting me under stress etc.  </p>

<p>I like to stay in freedom instead and I am able to manifest money. How I am doing this you might ask. Maybe from selling this book. Maybe I will find money on the streets. I don't know. My subconsciousness will do this for me. <br />
I have just ordered it in from the universe.</p>

<p>It would be very nice if you share your personal experiences, how you manifested things, with me.</p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"><h1 id="fear">Fear</h1>

<p>What you are able to do against, when you are scared.  </p>

<p>We have three different times in our life.</p>

<h2 id="past">Past</h2>

<p>One is the past. Something that you have experienced an amount of time ago. Because of the fact that we, as a human being, are able to remember bad things more easily than good things, can lead to depression if we think about the past. <br />
One thing we can do is to write down all the good things happening to us that very day and read it from time to time to develop a good mood thinking about the past.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>Thinking about the future can lead to fear. Thoughts like, "the plane might crash", will keep you home instead of flying to a nice holiday location. <br />
"This or that might happen, if..." <br />
You are creating this scary thoughts on your own. <br />
If you know, that the future does not exist at all, then you will not get scared any more. Yes, future does not exit. Future is just a thought, an illusion. There is only the here an now.</p>

<h2 id="here-and-now">Here and now</h2>

<p>Even if you are doing something tomorrow, than you are not doing it in the future. You are doing it <strong>now</strong>. <br />
There is only <strong>now</strong>. Are you really sure, that you have experienced the things you have in memory? Of course you might say. But are you really sure? Have you got evidence?  </p>

<p>An example.
I am writing a book right now. I am really sure that I am writing a book right now. What if tomorrow my computer crashes and my book will be erased? I will have no evidence that I wrote a book the last day. <br />
True?  </p>

<p>Of course I am going to save my book in the cloud as soon I have wifi again. I am not an idiot.  </p>

<p>So for me, past and future does not exist at all. These are just constructs of the human mind. Also time does not exists at all. Time is an invention of people who wanted to control other human beings. They need time to track your working hours.  </p>

<p>Yes, I am also a budhist and a tantric teacher and my knowlegde I have from wise people. I don't know if this is the very truth at all, but I made the decision to belief in it. And what I belief in will manifest into my reality.  </p>

<p>If you are able to stay in the here and now, you are not getting scared any more. If you are getting scared, then you should just switch back to the here and now. <br />
Take a deep breath. Do you still feel fear? <br />
Is this what you are scared about happening right now? <br />
No, you are calm I hope and reading this book!  </p>

<h2 id="other-methods">Other methods</h2>

<h3 id="eft">EFT</h3>

<p>With EFT (Emotional Freedom Technology) you can knock away anxiety. EFT is a method to change your subconsciousness. You are repeating mantras over and over while knocking some spots on your body. You are doing it so long and so often until these mantras sink into your subconsciousness. A sample might be. "Even if I fear to fly with a plane, I accept myself as I am." You repeat this over and over until you get rid of the fear to fly with a plane.</p>

<h3 id="psych-k">Psych-K</h3>

<p>Psych-K is a very good and fast method to re-program your subconsciousness. With this method you combine both parts of the brain, go into a meditativ state of mind and think about, where this belief comes from. Often beliefs come from the parents, brothers, sisters, friends, school etc. Not all beliefs are based on a solid experience of ourselfs. Even if we have made an experience, our subconsciousness still beliefs and reacts based on beliefs. When I say that it reacts, I mean most of the time we are running on auto pilot. Do you remember the first time you were driving with a bike? I have to think about almost every single muscle to move in the right order at the right time. Today I don't even think about my muscles any more. I just drive somewhere. My subconsciousness is doing that on it's own. The same is true for breathing, heartbeat, growing fingernails, growing the hair and splitting and regenerating cells. Everything on auto pilot. So if we reprogram ourself, we can change our life completely. This is also true for fears.  </p>

<h3 id="doing-until-its-fun">Doing until its fun</h3>

<p>Doing what you are scared about until you love todo it is also a good method I used once. I was driving a motorbike in Switzerland a few years ago. Every time I had to go through a tunnel I got scared to stuck in a traffic jam and will not be able to breath fresh air. I was remembering a post about dioxin in the Elbtunnel in Hamburg. Once there was a long tunnel like 8 km long. I was scared a bit. On my way back I had three options. One option was to use a pass. It was getting dark, so driving a pass scared me more. Going back the way I came also was no option, so I choosed to drive a different way even if there could have been even more tunnels. But I took the wrong entry to the highway and this leads me back into the same tunnel. Now I have tricked my brain thinking, "I made it here without dying, so I can also make it back" This has worked for me. A few months later, it was very hot and I had an open helmet. The air was to hot for me even driving my bike. It was about 36 degrees. Then I also was driving in a tunnel, but this time it felt really refreshing because the temperature was only 25 degrees. This way I could get rid of my fear about tunnels.</p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"><h1 id="health">Health</h1>

<p>If you want to live an independent life you should also stay healthy so that you do not need doctors or medicine.  </p>

<p>I tell you something. You don't need a disease anymore. <br />
Do your remember the first time when you are getting ill?  Often the first time is when you are going to kindergarten or school. That's because you are a bid more stressed than staying home. Being stressed shuts down our imunesystem and it's easier for diseases to break out. In fact when you are stressed, then your power to manifest things is getting lower. <br />
So... no stress, no disease. <br />
If you stop to believe in diseases you will not be feared of them anymore and therefore you do not attract them anymore.  </p>

<p>I remember that I was working as a mechanic one time. I had done three weeks the same things over and over again. It does not fulfill me at all.  So I woke up late in the morning and also came late to the job. The next day I also woke up late and don't wanted to go to work, because I was ashamed that I was late two times in a row. So I went to the doctor to get myself an excuse for my boss. To be able to tell the doctor the truth I was thinking about symthomes of a disease. This way I have manifested these symthoms.  </p>

<p>You get the point? <br />
I manifested my disease on my own. So is everybody doing. But if we don't want to work anymore and only doing what we love, than we don't have to go to the doctor anymore to get these excuses. We don't have to be sick anymore.  </p>

<p>So stop watching televison or watching radio, where they tell you about all the bad things that has happen in the world. They are doing this only to make us stressed, so that we do not come into our might. Into our higher being.  </p>

<p>If we are not stressed we are able to meditate. Meditating brings us next to our higher self. You should also meditate when you are stressed to calm down.</p>

<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>

<p>For me vegetables and fruits are the best for my body. <br />
We should stop eating meat, because when a animal dies, then stress hormons were produced in the animal and this is then inside the meat. <br />
Also, we are eating meat, because of the prana inside of the meat. The animals get the prana out of the fruits and the fruits get the prana from the sun. Why not use the prana from the sun directly? <br />
It's a ongoing process. We can not switch to be a breatharian adhoc, but we are able to stop eating and therefore killing animals. <br />
It's more healthy to eat veggies instead.  </p>

<p>I know from a good friend, that she survived her cancer eating only raw food. Raw veggies of course.  </p>

<h2 id="breathing">Breathing</h2>

<p>To get prana it is also important to breath more deeper into our belly. So smoking is not a good option. Instead we should breath more on a conscious way to get more prana. <br />
If you feel unhealthy you should fast and only drink water.  Not eating for three full days resets your imune system and every additional day cleans your body. While fasting you should avoid stress. Meditating and breathwork in the sun while fasting is the key to get prana. <br />
I am fasting on a regular base. Every two month I am fasting for at least 5 days and if I am in a good environment, like a rainbow gathering, I am fasting even longer like 12 days.</p>
